1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
   The main advantage to using setImmediate() over setTimeout() is setImmediate() will always be executed before any timers if 
   scheduled within an I/O cycle, independently of how many timers are present.

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate
   setImmediate - runs after I/O event callbacks at 'check' phase of the event loop
   process.nextTick - runs immediately after the current pahse of the eventlopp before continuing to the next phase
   
3. Does Node.js has window object?
   No, it has window like object called globalThis.
